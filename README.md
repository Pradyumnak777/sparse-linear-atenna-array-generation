# sparse-linear-atenna-array-generation
This python code attempts to generate a sparse linear antenna array (of weight = 1) with the highest aperture, for a given array size.

As the size of the array increases, the time taken to generate more solutions also incraeses exponentially. 

This code does not generate the most optimal array sequence for a given size.

Results from this code have hinted at a new suboptimal sequence/pattern for generating linear sparse atenna arrays, resulting in a paper - https://www.jpier.org/issues/volume.html?paper=23102706
