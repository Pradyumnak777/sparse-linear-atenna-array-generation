# sparse-linear-atenna-array-generation
This python code attempts to exhaustively generate all sparse linear antenna arrays with weight = 1.

As the size of the array increases, the time taken to generate more solutions also incraeses exponentially. 

This code does not generate the most optimal array sequence for a given size.

Results from this code have hinted at a new suboptimal sequence/pattern for generating linear sparse atenna arrays, resulting in a paper - https://www.jpier.org/issues/volume.html?paper=23102706
